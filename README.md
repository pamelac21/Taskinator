We used Bootstrap to save time and frustration by using their pre-built CSS styles.

We learned how to use jQuery UI for functionality we'd otherwise have to build from scratch.

We were introduced to the complexities of date and time functionality in JavaScript and how MomentJS can be used to help us in those situations.
